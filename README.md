# Tetris clone on Kiwi.js

Thought about giving a try on [Kiwi.js game engine](https://github.com/gamelab/kiwi.js), so I wrote a simple Tetris clone. Great thing about this engine is that it can be easily wrapped with CocoonJs into mobile game.
To play the game you can go to my site or you can download it.

**Progress:**

Game is v0.8. Upcoming features:
* configurations;
* buttons to control on screen;
* new assets and ui;
* mobile version.

**Installation:**

If it is your first time trying to play the game, run

```npm install ```

afterwards run

```gulp ``` 

and open your browser on  [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

**Bugs:**

Feel free to open an issue if something is not working properly.
